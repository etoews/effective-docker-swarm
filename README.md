# Effective Docker Swarm

Swarm is Docker's answer to clustering by treating a group of Docker hosts as a single host. It uses the native Docker API so you can use the whole ecosystem of Docker tooling with it. If you're already familiar with Docker, you can take everything you've already learned and immediately apply it to Swarm. If you're unfamiliar with Docker, it's very easy to get started.

After getting started, how do you use Swarm effectively?

Developing and deploying a distributed application on Swarm requires a deeper understanding. It involves knowledge of building images, storing data, overlay networks, security, and service discovery. We'll conclude by taking a look at some of the things people have built and deployed on Swarm.

Let's take a tour of how to Swarm with Carina, a service that builds Docker Swarm clusters for you.
